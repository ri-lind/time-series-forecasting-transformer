## SAMformer Code and Experiments
This repository, the design and the implementation of **SAMformer** were developed by [Romain Ilbert](https://romilbert.github.io/) who also conducted the experiments presented in the paper. Paper slides can be found [here](https://romilbert.github.io/samformer_slides.pdf).

## Overview
**SAMformer** is a novel lightweight transformer architecture designed for time series forecasting. It uniquely integrates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) with a Channel-Wise Attention mechanism. This method provides state-of-the-art performance in multivariate long-term forecasting across various forecasting tasks. In particular, SAMformer surpasses [TSMixer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wbpxTuXgm0) by $\mathbf{14.33}$% on average, while having $\mathbf{\sim4}$ times fewer parameters, and [iTransformer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JePfAI8fah) and [PatchTST](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14730) by $\mathbf{6.58}$% and $\mathbf{8.79}$% respectively.

## Architecture
**SAMformer** takes as input a $D$-dimensional time series of length $L$ (*look-back window*), arranged in a matrix $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times L}$ and predicts its next $H$ values (*prediction horizon*), denoted by $\mathbf{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times H}$. The main components of the architecture are the following. 

ðŸ’¡ **Shallow transformer encoder.** The neural network at the core of SAMformer is a shallow encoder of a simplified [Transformer](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf). Channel-wise attention is applied to the input, followed by a residual connection. Instead of the usual feedforward block, a linear layer is directly applied on top of the residual connection to output the prediction.

ðŸ’¡ **Channel-Wise Attention.**  Contrary to the usual temporal attention in $\mathbb{R}^{L \times L}$, the channel-wise self-attention is represented by a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$ and consists of the pairwise correlations between the input's features. This brings two important benefits: 
- Feature permutation invariance, eliminating the need for positional encoding, commonly applied before the attention layer;
- Reduced time and memory complexity as $D \leq L$ in most of the real-world datasets.

ðŸ’¡ **Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN).** The resulting network is equipped with [RevIN](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=cGDAkQo1C0p), a two-step normalization scheme to handle the shift between the training and testing time series.
 
ðŸ’¡ **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM).** As suggested by our empirical and theoretical analysis, we optimize the model with [SAM](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6Tm1mposlrM) to make it converge towards flatter minima, hence improving its generalization capacity. 

SAMformer uniquely combines all these components in a lightweight implementation with very few hyperparameters. We display below the resulting architecture.

## Results
We conduct our experiments on various multivariate time series forecasting benchmarks. 

ðŸ¥‡ **Improved performance.** SAMformer outperforms its competitors in $\mathbf{7}$ **out of** $\mathbf{8}$ datasets by a large margin. In particular, it improves over its best competitor TSMixer+SAM by $\mathbf{5.25}$%, surpasses the standalone TSMixer by $\mathbf{14.33}$%, and the best transformer-based model FEDformer by $\mathbf{12.36}$%. In addition, it improves over the vanilla Transformer by $\mathbf{16.96}$%. For each dataset and horizon, SAMformer is ranked either first or second.

ðŸš€ **Computational efficiency and versatility.** SAMformer has a lightweight implementation with few learnable parameters, contrary to most of its competitors, leading to improved computational efficiency. SAMformer significantly outperforms the SOTA in multivariate time series despite having fewer parameters. In addition, the same architecture is used for all the datasets, while most of the other baselines require heavy hyperparameter tuning, which showcases the versatility of our approach.

ðŸ“š **Qualitative benefits.** We display in our paper the benefits of SAMformer in terms of smoothness of the loss landscape, robustness to the prediction horizons, and signal propagation in the attention layer.
